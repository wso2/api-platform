Feature: Rate Limiting
  As an API developer
  I want to limit the rate of requests to my API
  So that I can protect my upstream services from excessive traffic

  Background:
    Given the gateway services are running

  Scenario: Enforce rate limit on API resource
    Given I authenticate using basic auth as "admin"
    When I deploy this API configuration:
      """
