  title: Gateway Controller API
  description: |
    REST API for managing API configurations in the WSO2 API Platform Gateway.

    The Gateway Controller accepts API configurations in YAML or JSON format and dynamically
    configures the Router (Envoy Proxy) via xDS protocol. Supports full CRUD lifecycle
    for API configurations with real-time updates to the Router.

    **Key Features:**
    - Submit API configurations in YAML or JSON
    - Real-time validation and error reporting
    - Zero-downtime configuration updates
    - Persistent storage with SQLite
    - Query deployed API configurations
  version: 1.0.0

      summary: Create a new API configuration
      description: |
        Submit a new API configuration to the Gateway Controller. The configuration
        is validated, persisted, and translated to Envoy xDS resources. The Router
        begins routing traffic for the API within 5 seconds.

        **Validation Rules:**
        - API name + version combination must be unique
        - Context must start with `/` and not end with `/`
        - At least one upstream and one operation required
        - For same API name, context must be consistent across versions
