description: |
  This policy provides the capability to transform a request/response with an XML payload to a request/response with a JSON payload.
  This policy assumes that the request/response payload is XML. Attempting to use it on a request/response with a non-XML payload will result in premature termination of the mediation flow.
  For the same reason, this policy cannot be attached multiple times to a resource since once it is used, the payload will be a JSON value.

        Enables XML to JSON transformation for incoming request payloads (client to upstream).
        When set to true, XML request bodies will be converted to JSON format before forwarding to upstream services.
        When set to false, request bodies will be passed through unchanged.
    onResponseFlow:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Enables XML to JSON transformation for outgoing response payloads (upstream to client).
        When set to true, XML response bodies will be converted to JSON format before returning to clients.
        When set to false, response bodies will be passed through unchanged.
