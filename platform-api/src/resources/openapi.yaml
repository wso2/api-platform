  title: WSO2 API Platform - Platform API
  description: |
    This document specifies a **RESTful API** for WSO2 **API Platform** - **Platform API**.
    
    ## Authentication
    
    All API endpoints (except organization registration) require authentication using JWT access tokens 
    generated by Thunder STS (Security Token Service).
    
    ### JWT Token Requirements
    
    - **Token Format**: Bearer token in Authorization header
    - **Required Claim**: `organization` - UUID of the user's organization
    - **Token Validation**: In development mode, signature validation can be skipped using `JWT_SKIP_VALIDATION=true`
    
    ### Organization Isolation
    
    All API operations are automatically scoped to the organization specified in the JWT token's 
    `organization` claim. Organization IDs are no longer required in request bodies or query parameters.

    post:
      summary: Fetch Git repository content
      description: |
        Fetches and returns the directory and file structure of a specified public Git repository with depth-based pagination.
        This endpoint supports multiple Git providers including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
        The provider can be specified explicitly or will be auto-detected from the repository URL.
        
        **Depth-Based Pagination:**
        Use the optional `depth` query parameter to limit repository traversal depth. For example:
        - `depth=1`: Returns only root-level files and directories
        - `depth=2`: Returns files and directories within two levels from the root
        - `depth=0` or omitted: Returns all content (default behavior)
        
        This approach helps balance data completeness and performance by allowing incremental loading of deeper structures.
        The response includes directories (both empty and non-empty) and files at the specified depth levels.
        
        This endpoint is used to verify repository accessibility and display its structure in the API Platform UI
        for API import functionality. Only public repositories are supported.
