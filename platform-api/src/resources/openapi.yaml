  title: WSO2 API Platform - Platform API
  description: |
    This document specifies a **RESTful API** for WSO2 **API Platform** - **Platform API**.
    
    ## Authentication
    
    All API endpoints (except organization registration) require authentication using JWT access tokens 
    generated by Thunder STS (Security Token Service).
    
    ### JWT Token Requirements
    
    - **Token Format**: Bearer token in Authorization header
    - **Required Claim**: `organization` - UUID of the user's organization
    - **Token Validation**: In development mode, signature validation can be skipped using `JWT_SKIP_VALIDATION=true`
    
    ### Organization Isolation
    
    All API operations are automatically scoped to the organization specified in the JWT token's 
    `organization` claim. Organization IDs are no longer required in request bodies or query parameters.
