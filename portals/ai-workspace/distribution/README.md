# WSO2 API Platform — AI Workspace

A standalone distribution of the AI Workspace and Platform API, orchestrated with Docker Compose. The AI Workspace is a React SPA served by a Go BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) that proxies all browser traffic same-origin and owns authentication — tokens live in a server-side session (HttpOnly cookie) and never reach the browser.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+
- Docker Compose v2
- `openssl`, and either `htpasswd` or Docker (used by `setup.sh` to bcrypt-hash the admin password)

## Quick Start

Run the setup script once, from the distribution root, before the first start:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
docker compose up -d
```

`setup.sh` generates everything the stack needs — nothing is auto-generated at runtime:

| Output | Contents |
|---|---|
| `api-platform.env` (git-ignored) | `APIP_CP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (at-rest encryption), `APIP_CP_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `APIP_CP_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (bcrypt) |
| `resources/keys/jwt_private.pem` + `jwt_public.pem` (git-ignored) | RS256 keypair signing/verifying login JWTs; read by `config.toml` via `{{ file }}` |
| `resources/certificates/cert.pem` + `key.pem` | Self-signed TLS pair shared by both services (SAN: `localhost`, `platform-api`, `ai-workspace`) |

The admin password is generated and printed once by `setup.sh` — it is not stored anywhere; only its bcrypt hash lands in `api-platform.env`. Re-running `setup.sh` keeps existing files; pass `--force` to rotate keys and credentials, or `--certs-only` to (re)generate just the TLS pair. `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables skip the interactive prompts (used by CI to pin known test credentials).

For production, prefer mounting secret files and referencing them from the config TOMLs with `{{ file "..." }}` instead of `api-platform.env` — see [Configuration](#configuration) below.

Verify both services are healthy:

```bash
curl -fk https://localhost:9243/health    # Platform API
curl -fk https://localhost:9643/healthz   # AI Workspace
```

Open the AI Workspace in a browser at `https://localhost:9643` and log in with the admin credentials printed by `setup.sh`.

> **Browser trust warning?** Both services use a self-signed TLS certificate by default. Click **Advanced → Proceed** to continue. See [Custom TLS Certificates](#custom-tls-certificates) to remove the warning permanently.

## Exposed Ports

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `9643` | AI Workspace (BFF) | HTTPS — browser entry point |
| `9243` | Platform API | HTTPS — backend REST API |
| `9543` | Developer Portal | HTTPS — only when the `with-developer-portal` profile is enabled (see below) |

## Developer Portal (optional)

This package runs AI Workspace and the Platform API by default. The **Developer Portal** ships in the same `docker-compose.yaml` as an optional component behind the `with-developer-portal` [Compose profile](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/profiles/), sharing the one Platform API — so you can add it without standing up a second Platform API.

The portal mounts the **same** `configs/config.toml` the other services do and reads only its own `[developer_portal]` section (it ignores `[ai_workspace]`/`[platform_api]`, including their tokens). It is **off by default**: a plain `docker compose up -d` never starts it. Enabling it takes two one-time steps, because that shipped `config.toml` does **not** carry a `[developer_portal]` section:

1. **Add the `[developer_portal]` section to `configs/config.toml`.** Copy the `[developer_portal.*]` tables from the bottom of the shipped `configs/config-template.toml` (the "Developer Portal (optional)" section) and append them to this stack's `configs/config.toml`. The compose stack already provides everything they reference — the defaults point at `https://platform-api:9243` and read the JWT public key from `/etc/devportal/keys/jwt_public.pem`.
2. **Add its required secrets** to `api-platform.env`. The portal fails closed at startup without them:

   ```bash
   echo "APIP_DP_SECURITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> api-platform.env
   echo "APIP_DP_SECURITY_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> api-platform.env
   ```

Then start the stack with the profile enabled:

```bash
docker compose --profile with-developer-portal up -d
```

The portal comes up at `https://localhost:9543`, verifying Platform API-issued tokens with the same RS256 public key the rest of the stack uses. It keeps its own data in the `developer-portal-data` volume. Omit `--profile with-developer-portal` on any later `docker compose` command to leave it stopped.

## Configuration

Both services read their settings from the single `configs/config.toml` — Platform API's `[platform_api.*]` tables and AI Workspace's `[ai_workspace.*]` tables live side by side in the same file (each service reads only its own top-level table and ignores the other's), and `docker-compose.yaml` mounts that one file into both containers. Edit it and restart the affected service — no rebuild required.

Each config key writes its value as a `'{{ env "..." }}'` token, so it can be set from the environment without editing the file — the token names the variable, by convention the key's path uppercased and prefixed `APIP_AIW_` (AI Workspace) or `APIP_CP_` (Platform API), e.g. `APIP_AIW_LOGGING_LEVEL`, `APIP_CP_DATABASE_HOST`. A key with no token is not settable from the environment: uncomment or add it in the TOML first. To source a value from a mounted file instead — the right choice for secrets — swap the token for `'{{ file "/secrets/..." }}'`. Never write a secret as a raw literal.

Environment overrides go in `api-platform.env` (git-ignored; loaded into both containers via `env_file`, format `raw`, since the bcrypt password hash contains `$`, which must not be treated as a compose interpolation variable). This is also where OIDC mode's `APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` belongs — it's the only file compose passes into the containers, so a separate `.env` alongside it would never reach the app.

### AI Workspace (`[ai_workspace.*]`)

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[ai_workspace] default_org_region` | Default region assigned to new organizations on first login |
| `[ai_workspace.auth] mode` | `basic` (file-based quickstart) or `oidc` (external IDP) |
| `[ai_workspace.control_plane].url` | Base URL of the upstream Platform API hop |
| `[ai_workspace.control_plane].ca_file` | PEM bundle trusted for the upstream's TLS cert (appended to system roots). Fixed to the mounted path — not env-overridable; edit the TOML if you change the volume mount in `docker-compose.yaml` |
| `[ai_workspace.control_plane].tls_skip_verify` | Skip upstream cert verification — local dev only |
| `[ai_workspace.gateway].controlplane_host` | Address gateways use to reach the Platform API |
| `[ai_workspace.gateway].platform_gateway_versions` | Gateway versions shown in the create-gateway selector |
| `[ai_workspace.server.https].cert_file` / `key_file` | HTTPS listener certificate pair. Fixed to the mounted path, same as `ca_file` above |
| `[ai_workspace.auth.oidc].*` | Used only when `[ai_workspace.auth] mode = "oidc"` — see [OIDC](#oidc-production) below |

### Platform API (`[platform_api.*]`)

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `[platform_api.logging].level` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`; matched case-insensitively) |
| `[platform_api.security].encryption_key` | Single 32-byte key (64 hex chars or base64) used for all at-rest encryption (secrets, subscription tokens, WebSub HMAC secrets). Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `[platform_api.database].driver` | `sqlite3` or `postgres` |
| `[platform_api.auth].mode` | `file` (quickstart default), `external_token`, or `idp` — selects exactly one auth mode |
| `[platform_api.auth.jwt].public_key_file` / `private_key_file` | RS256 (asymmetric) PEM keys; `public_key_file` verifies every token, `private_key_file` signs login JWTs in `file` mode. Read via `{{ file }}` — HMAC and unsigned tokens are rejected |
| `[platform_api.auth.idp]` | JWKS-based IDP auth — active when `mode = "idp"`; configure for Asgardeo, Keycloak, Auth0, etc. |
| `[platform_api.auth.file.users]` | Local user credentials, active when `mode = "file"` (change the password hash before sharing) |
| `[platform_api.server.https]` | Listener on `:9243`; `cert_file`/`key_file` point at `cert.pem`/`key.pem` |

Each key's default value is written inline in `configs/config-template.toml` — a
fully-commented reference of every available setting and its default for both active
components, plus the optional `[developer_portal]` section at the bottom, so defaults
are not restated here.

## Authentication Modes

### File-based (default)

The admin user is generated by `setup.sh` (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)). To set your own password instead, generate a new bcrypt hash:

```bash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" NEW_PASSWORD | tr -d ':\n'
```

Replace the `password_hash` value under `[platform_api.auth.file.users]` in `configs/config.toml` before starting.

### OIDC (production)

To delegate login to an external OIDC-compliant provider (Asgardeo, Keycloak, Auth0, etc.) instead of file-based auth, both services need to be reconfigured — the AI Workspace to send users to the IDP, and the Platform API to trust the tokens it issues.

1. Register a **confidential** OIDC application in your IDP with redirect URL `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback` (use `https://localhost:9643/api/auth/callback` for local development), a post-logout redirect URL, and enable the **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token** grants.
2. **AI Workspace** (`configs/config.toml`): set `[ai_workspace.auth] mode = "oidc"`. Every `[ai_workspace.auth.oidc]` key except `scope` defaults to empty and the server refuses to start in OIDC mode until each is set — either directly in the TOML or via its `APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_*` token in `api-platform.env`:

   ```bash
   APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_AUTHORITY=https://idp.example.com
   APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
   APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
   APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL=https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback
   APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=https://<your-domain>/login
   ```

   Leaving `APIP_AIW_AUTH_OIDC_SCOPE` unset requests the full `ap:*` scope set.

3. **Platform API** (`[platform_api.*]` tables in `configs/config.toml`): the `[platform_api.auth.idp]` fields have no env-var tokens in the quickstart file, so edit the TOML directly — set `[platform_api.auth] mode = "idp"` and fill in `jwks_url` and `issuer` for your IDP. `mode` selects exactly one auth mode, so switching to `"idp"` stops the file-based login endpoint from being used. Align `[platform_api.auth.claim_mappings]` with `[ai_workspace.auth.claim_mappings]` — both services must read the same claims out of the same token.

See `configs/config-template.toml` for the full, per-field reference of both active components (and the optional `[developer_portal]` section at the bottom), and the [WSO2 API Platform documentation](https://wso2.com/api-platform/docs/) (AI Workspace section) for a full OIDC setup walkthrough including Asgardeo scope registration.

## Custom TLS Certificates

`resources/certificates/` holds the TLS pair shared by both services — `cert.pem` (certificate or full chain) and `key.pem` (private key), generated by `setup.sh`. This one directory is mounted read-only into both containers at their `/etc/<service>/tls` path. To remove the browser trust warning, replace both files with a certificate from your own CA (same file names) whose SAN list covers all three hostnames (`localhost`, `platform-api`, `ai-workspace`), then restart:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Database

The Platform API uses **SQLite** by default (data persisted in a Docker volume). To switch to PostgreSQL, update `[platform_api.database]` in `configs/config.toml`:

```toml
[platform_api.database]
driver = "postgres"
host   = "your-db-host"
port   = 5432
name   = "platform_api"
user   = "platform_api"
password = '{{ file "/secrets/platform-api/postgres_password" }}'
ssl_mode = "disable"
```

The `resources/platform-api/db-scripts/` directory contains the schema scripts (`schema.postgres.sql`, `schema.sqlite.sql`, `schema.sqlserver.sql`). The Platform API applies the appropriate schema automatically on startup — no manual SQL execution is required.
